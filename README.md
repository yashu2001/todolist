# Todo List
This is a simple todolist project made using vanilla javascript and helped me to understand the fundamentals of html dom manipulation, using the browsers local storage.
# Project Structuring
The main directory of the project contains index.html and 1.js. The file 1.js contains the java script logic for the project.This project also works offline since it utilizes the local storage of the browser.
# Styling
Special thanks to materialize css for the awesome stylesheet.
